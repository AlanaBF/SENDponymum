# SENDponymum

## Overview

SENDponymum is dedicated to empowering children with special educational needs within the equine community. Founded by Rebecca Moore, a devoted mother and advocate, this platform serves as a beacon of support and information. Here, families can find resources, share experiences, and connect with a community that understands their unique journeys.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide an accessible space where families of children with special educational needs can explore the benefits of equine therapy, share their stories, and find community support. We strive to offer up-to-date information and personal anecdotes that make the equine therapy journey informative and enriching.
